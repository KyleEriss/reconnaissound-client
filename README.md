For your capstone, we'd like you to add a README.md file to your repo. At a minimum, this file should contain:

The name of your app at the top of the file.
A link to your live app.
Documentation of your API.
Screenshot(s) of your app. This makes your app description much easier to understand.
A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.
A section on the technology used.


Reconnaissound

The Reconnaissound web app lets users generate a list of trending YouTube music videos from any country in the world. Users can watch the videos directly on the web app, without needing to follow links to Youtube. Users can also save any of the content to their personalized playlist.

To set up a playlist, a user must create an account first. Their credentials are encrypted and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to grant authorization.

Here's a link to the live app: https://reconnaissound-client.vercel.app/

You can access repo to the client app here: https://github.com/KyleEriss/reconnaissound-client

You can access repo to the server app here: https://github.com/KyleEriss/reconnaissound-server
